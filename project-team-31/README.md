# Software Engineering Cards

Iteration 1 velocity: initially the velocity was expected to be 0.4, in fact, the actual amount of time we spent in iteration 1 was way less than expected -- 70 hours! The expected time was 112 hours. The velocity for the iteration 1 is then calculated as: 45 / 70 = 0.64; For iteration 2, our user story was expected to be implemented in 45 hours as well, with the velocity from the first iteration, we planned to use 45 / 0.64 = 70 hours as a team to do the actual work.
